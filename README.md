# Custom Automatic Weather Station
The aim of C-AWS was to develop from scratch a capable automatic weather station (AWS) system using non-professional sensors and electronics. This repository contains the core software system, designed to run on a Raspberry Pi. See [C-AWS Server](https://github.com/henryshunt/c-aws-server) for a system to view the data generated by this system.

# Breakdown
The software is split into a `data` subsystem, which logs sensor data and generates statistics, and a `support` subsystem, which provides all other supporting functionality (such as data uploading and power controls). There was previously also an `access` subsystem which provided access to the data via a web server, but this was split out into the [C-AWS Server](https://github.com/henryshunt/c-aws-server) repository.

Data is saved to an SQLite3 database, and if camera logging is enabled then the images are saved to a USB drive. Any errors that occur during operation will be logged to an `error_log.txt` file in the specified `DataDirectory`. Data can also be uploaded to a remote server hosting [C-AWS Server](https://github.com/henryshunt/c-aws-server).

`main.py` is the entry point for the software system. It performs initialisation and system checks before starting the subsystems as background processes. The rest of the code comprises a set of routines to support the codebase, as well as a set of classes that abstract each sensor behind a common interface.

# Usage
Supported sensors: DS18B20 (temperature), SHT31-D (humidity), Inspeed Classic Anemometer (wind speed), Inspeed E-Vane II (wind direction), Instromet Mini Sun Board with binary output (sunshine duration), Rainwise Rainew 111 (rainfall), BME280 (pressure), Raspberry Pi Camera Module (camera).

- Run `SETUP.sh` to download and install the required dependencies
- Set the system time zone to UTC
- If logging from a camera, create a mount directory for a USB drive to store the images
- Edit the file `/etc/rc.local` (things to do at boot) and before the `exit 0` line:
    - If logging from a camera, mount the drive to the created mount directory (add e.g. `mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/c-aws-cam`)
    - Add `cd <path to C-AWS software directory>`
    - Add `sudo python3 main.py`
- Configure the operation of the C-AWS software (see the configuration section below)
- Setup an instance of [C-AWS Server](https://github.com/henryshunt/c-aws-server) to view the data
- Restart the computer to run the software

# Configuration
Use `config.ini` to supply station information, data save locations, data upload endpoints, operation configuration, and sensor configuration. Various option values can be omitted if they have nothing that depends on them (e.g. you don't need to provide a `CameraDirectory` value if `CameraLogging` is not enabled).

|Option|Description|

# Error Codes
A set of error codes are used to indicate a failure during initialisation and startup of the software. These codes are conveyed by continuously flashing the error LED a number of times to indicate the number of the error code, with each set of flashes separated by a longer pause. The error codes are listed below.

A situation where both the data and error LEDs illuminate for 2.5 seconds, go off, and then come back on momentarily indicates a successful startup of the software. However after this, a 10-flash error code indicates that the data subsystem encountered an error while initialising one of the sensors that are marked in the configuration file as being connected.

|Flashes|Description|
|--|--|
|1|The configuration file contains an invalid or bad configuration description|
|2|Not enough free space (< 1GB) remains on the internal drive (or error getting space)|
|3|An error occurred while creating the `DataDirectory`|
|4|An error occurred while creating a new database file in the `DataDirectory`|
|5|The specified `CameraDirectory` does not exist|
|6|The specified `CameraDirectory` does not have a USB drive mounted|
|7|Not enough free space (< 5GB) remains on the `CameraDirectory` drive (or error getting space)|
